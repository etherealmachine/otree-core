# oTree WebComponents
The oTree WebComponents are a set of curated web components that enable
experimenters to drop  rich content and interactivity into an oTree experiment.
With web components you can add interactive charts, rich visualizations like
heatmaps. Optional integration with [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) can
enable subsession inter-subject communication, like real-time chat and strategy
updates.

## What are WebComponents?

### For Experimenters
oTree has a curated library of components you can drop into your experiment at
TODO. Read over the descriptions to find the component you need for your
particular experiment. Each component has some examples to demonstrate how it
looks on a subject's page. Many components are highly configurable and can be
adapted to your use-case. If not, authoring a component is possible but does
require some programming knowledge.

### For Developers
A web component is a collection of HTML, CSS, and Javascript packaged into an
HTML tag that can be dropped into an HTML page. If you're not familiar with
components, check out the [walkthrough](TODO) of how the
otree-chat component works. Components can leverage the full suite of web
technologies. Components exist with examples of real-time communication using
websockets and GPU-accelerated graphics with WebGL.
